# thirdparty-libs
Third party libs that for one reason or another can't be used directly from a third party repository.
One common reason is the case where a library is not packaged in a certain way originally. For example
this can be the case with a lot of c++ code that is not packaged as a Bazel repository.

This only contains libraries/sources that are publicly available.
